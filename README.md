This is showcasing the use of .NET Core 6.0, N-Tier Architecture, Unit Of Work, Repository Pattern, Identity Management, Web API, Data Transfer Object (DTO), Fluent Validation, Ajax, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Description
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the implementation of a web application using a combination of technologies and architectural patterns. It provides a foundation for building scalable, maintainable, and secure applications with robust identity management and API endpoints.

Features
N-Tier Architecture: The project follows the N-Tier architecture, which separates the application into multiple layers, including presentation, business logic, and data access. This architectural pattern improves modularity, maintainability, and testability.

Unit Of Work: The project incorporates the Unit Of Work pattern to manage database transactions and ensure data consistency. This pattern groups related operations into a single transaction, simplifying data access and improving data integrity.

Repository Pattern: The Repository pattern is used to abstract the data access layer and provide a consistent way to interact with the database. It encapsulates data access logic and promotes code reusability.

Identity Management: The project includes identity management functionality using .NET Core's built-in Identity framework. This allows for user registration, login, and access control, ensuring secure access to protected resources.

Web API: The project exposes a Web API layer, allowing clients to interact with the application's functionality. This API follows RESTful principles and provides endpoints for CRUD operations and other business-specific actions.

Data Transfer Object (DTO): The project utilizes DTOs to transfer data between the client and server. DTOs encapsulate the data being exchanged and provide a standardized structure for communication, improving interoperability and reducing coupling.

Fluent Validation: The project incorporates Fluent Validation, a validation library, to perform input validation and ensure data integrity. It provides a flexible and expressive way to define validation rules and handle validation errors.

Ajax: The project uses Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) to enable asynchronous communication between the client and server. This allows for seamless and efficient data retrieval and updates without requiring a full page refresh.

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: The project leverages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for building the user interface and implementing client-side interactivity. HTML provides the structure of the web pages, CSS enhances the visual styling, and JavaScript adds dynamic behavior to the application.
